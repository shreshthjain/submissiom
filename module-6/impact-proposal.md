## Summary of the community's shared struggles
The shared struggles of my community is lack of opportunities and availablity of funds and resources. After having talks with many existing github campus experts like Rishabh Bansal, I came across one 
common issue with most of the communties i.e lack of women as community members. Women are less likely to be community members
because of a risk of being judged and subject to criticism. They undermine their worth and consider themselves less priviledged
as compared to other men. My goal is to create inclusive, equitable and diverse place of learning and enviornment. 

## What does your community look like once it's shared struggles are solved?

Solving each and every struggle that the community is going to be most of the difficult to acheive but nothing is impossible.
Starting with a mere 85 community members, I hope to multiply this number manifolds every year. The ultimate aim is that these 85 members inspire
hundreds of more people and help them become active member of the community. Most of the members being freshman initially, hope to gain confidence and understand self worth.
Because when people realise their true potentials, wonders can happen. 
The major reason why a community achieves its goals and become a success is majorly because they are in constant touch with each other
and share their grievances. Weekly meetings, chat forums and webinars helps keep track of weekly goals which acts as small steps to achieve 
the big goal. Organising workshops on various subjects, inspirational talks by other community leaders, hackathons to keep
the competitive spirit high are some of the keys points which makes this community a success.

## Proposal
### Hands-on Workshops on diverse topics <br>
It helps the community to be aware of the latest technologies and current trends in the technical world. As specified earlier, the 
goal is not to steer any community member in a particular direction but to help them set their own path. Let them be the decision makers.
Most community members usualy lacks guidance and these workshops will help them to get a hands-on experience on various interesting topics
and have something to take away from each session.
### Inspirational Talks
It is usually noticed that the community members are usualy motivated in the start but tend to lost motivation as time progresses. Ocassionally, 
talks like these are necessary to steer the motivation among members. Its been known that you get inspired the most when you hear someone else's story.
This will tackle the lack of motivation problem. So that no matter what, we never lose a eye to our dreams. Ensuring maximum
participation in these talks will determine success.
### Monthly Hackathons and weekly meetings
This will help to create a sense of belongingness among the members and help them to keep their competitive spirits high. When there's 
healthy competition and people compete to make some products which can be of some real use and solve some real problems, the success rate gets high.
Weekly meetings help to analyse how far we are from our goals and how much we have acheived yet. They keep the community 
members connected and be in constant touch. The hackathons can be successful is some kind of in-kind prize can be provided at the end to the winner
to acknowledge the efforts of the winning team.





## Resources
Major resources required are funding, training materials, prices and some in-kind prices. Some of the major resources can be
attained by scholarship funding from various organisations. Being the sole community leader, i'll be handling the whole community myself and
hence the sole representator of the proposal.


## Timeline

Phase 1:

- Some interesting and fun activities along with some insightful and knowledgable sessions will be hosted so that it will help them feel a sense of belongingness in the community. Some of them include:

*TechToFame -* On the spot problem solving competition. Write your approach and present it to a panel. The most original, real life applicable and innovative idea wins. Throught this acitivity, the community members will learn problem solving skills and different ways to approach an issue. <br>
*Express Coding-* one day online-programming competition where the person has to write the shortest code and can take home some amazing prizes!! <br>

- Communication Channels will be changed to a more actively used means. Whatsapp and Discord are considered some of the most popular means of virtual conversation. Hence shifting to more of these spaces will be helpful. 

Phase 2:

This phase will be a crucial part of all the phases as here we will work upon the sustainment and effective implementation  of the phase 1. 

Now, at this point, the question arises that we have the solution but how to sustain it for a long period, so that the engagement of members of my community stay. 

Here questions like  "How to plan these engagement events every semester? Who will be responsible for them? Which team will take care of it? etc." are kept in mind.

- First of all, I think team distribution for different kind of works will be the best, like Technical Team, Marketing Team, Operation Team, Logistics Team, Problem Solving Team etc. 

This will help students of my community join their field of interest, maintaining engagement and participation. 

- Hackathon - Workshop -Talks - Seminars having a series works really well. Like a hackathon having its second edition creates a great impact on the participation because if it's the previous version is good, then participants tend to participate in it again. Inpirational talks by some great women leaders help instill confidence in young minds and help them get inspiration. 
 

Phase 3:

After successful completion of phase 2, which solves some of the major challenges my community faces, Phase 3 will work on the future of the community. Here I see my community to be perfect! Though there's always a room for improvement! 

<I>Each phase will be 2-3 months long. After the completion of each phase, a final report will be made which will contain the progress made by every community member. A feedback form will be collected from everyone which contain the personal review of each member regarding the particular phase so that improvement can be done on the areas which lacked expertise. The progress of the members will be compared with the previous month report. If the graph of improvement is in the positive direction, it will mean that the phase was completed successfully.  </I> 

## Planning for the Future
An monthly review report will help to keep all things in check. It will help to anaylse the impact created as of now and what 
more needs to be done to make the community acheive its goals. Each community member is going to be its own measure of success.
Their internal growth is what this community aims of achieving through various workshops and activities. More the participation, more the success rate.
