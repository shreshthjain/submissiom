# Talk Planning
<b> Tell us a little bit about your talk: </b>

- <b>What is the topic? </b> <br>
Individuality.

- <b>Why do you care about it? </b><br>
It's not important that I should see someone related to me and then I talk about a topic. When I'm asked to define myself, what are the basic bases? Name? Sex? Age?
These are the basics right? Now consider, the inability to define your own self? Uncanny. This inability is why I care talking about it.

- <b>What story might you be able to tell? </b><br>
Of a regular human being (because the term irregular for a fellow human, should be vanished). The doubt and apathy towards people who are not you and me, but them.

- <b>What is your goal? It might be to inform, persuade or entertain. </b><br>
Inform people about the basic meanings of some regular terms. 

- <b>Who is the intended audience in terms of skills, interests and experience? </b><br>
Anyone and everyone who is clueless or apathetic enough to not know about this. So literally everyone.

Gender and sex are two distinct terms. Sex is associated with the basic biological characteristics of a human, categorised as male, female, intersex. But one's sex doesn't have to be their gender; it is what they grow into, your identity. The three basic kinds are cisgenders, transgenders and genderqueers. conventionally, according to the sex one is born in, society expects females to have feminity and males have masculinity. the 3rd sex is even neglected in the society's considerations. due to these sex based expectations, gender roles exists. These stereotyped gender roles and feminism have a cause and effect kind of relationship. The neglected communities, popularly known as the LGBTQ+ community, is not based on just sex and gender, but also the sexuality of an individual. In addition, people known as straight are not just people attracted to opposite sexes/genders, a misconception. 'straight' is when one's sex, gender and sexuality aligns with the conventional rules; anyone out of this straight line, the society terms them as 'different'. A step towards belongingness and eradicating the word 'different', was the reinstatement of Section377.
