## Talk planning
Tell us a little bit about your talk:

- What is the topic?  <br>
Individuality.

- Why do you care about it? <br>
It's not important that I should see someone related to me and then I talk about a topic. When I'm asked to define myself, what are the basic bases? Name? Sex? Age?
These are the basics right? Now consider, the inability to define your own self? Uncanny. This inability is why I care talking about it.

- What story might you be able to tell? <br>
Of a regular human being (because the term irregular for a fellow human, should be vanished). The doubt and apathy towards people who are not you and me, but them.

- What is your goal? It might be to inform, persuade or entertain. <br>
Inform people about the basic meanings of some regular terms. 

- Who is the intended audience in terms of skills, interests and experience? <br>
Anyone and everyone who is clueless or apathetic enough to not know about this. So literally everyone.

## Talk proposal
### Talk title
Create a short snappy title for your talk <br>
DISCOVERING PASSION: BEGIN LIVING YOUR UNLIVED LIFE
### Abstract
Imagine you're at a conference and your talk has been accepted. At the same time as your talk, there are two others. An abstract is your talk's elevator pitch - convince people why they should come to yours. Start with some context, a problem statement or claim, and continue into your solution and a description of what the talk will be like.

Your abstract should be between 150-200 words as 1-2 paragraphs.
