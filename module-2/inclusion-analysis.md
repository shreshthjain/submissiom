## Who might be excluded in accessing your community activities in their current form?

Who might be excluded in accessing your community activities in their current form? 

Have a think about who might be excluded from your community and why this might be. Some examples might include: people with jobs, people with caring responsibilities such as a child or another family member, wheelchair users, women and non-binary people, mature students. This is far from a complete list, but enough to get you started. 

People with full time jobs might find it a little difficult to take out time for every hackathon and workshops being held. It has come to my notice that people with work from home jobs and part time opportunities are able to easily indulge in the activities. Many a times pregnant women/ women with newborn child also have a hard time indulging in the weekly discussions. 

## Handling negative scenarios

### What are some of the negative scenarios which might happen while running activities for your community which will make them less inclusive to marginalised groups?Try and provide at least 4-5 examples.
- People belonging to different groups have different beliefs and different ideologies which might be contracting to each other.
- Different level of intelligence of different people belonging to marginalised groups can find it sometimes diffciult to cope up with other and might feel intimated.
- Commintment of time can be one of the major issues. Even after taking care of everyone's need, there will always be some people whom schedule will collide with our timings and might create some issues.
- Designing and holding events which are audible and comfortable for everyone is challenging. Every person have different sense of comfort and 
to ensure that everyone is able to takeaway everything from the discussion/workshop can be difficult task.

### What steps will you take to avoid these scenarios?
Thinking about how to avoid these scenarios from the beginning is key. For each of the examples above, provide a
brief explanation about how you'll avoid them happening.
- Preparing for every sessions and workshops before hand and proof reading every presentation can be wonders. It helps to ensure 
that no beliefs of any community are targeted.
- Providing the prerequisites for every community activity can help every member to prepare for it before hand and seek help in case of any grievances.
- By creating a proper schedule of the month in advance and providing it to every member and asking them if they have an issue or not will help in reducing conflicts over the time.
- Another solution can be to conduct the activities twice a month so that any member who misses the first activity can compensate by being present in the second one.
- Carefully analysing the community areas and seminar halls before the day of the session can give some insightful information. 
Trying to ensure that every part of the community area is accessible and well marked can help to conduct the activities smoothly. 

## Designing for your community's needs
### Needs facilitated
What needs are you going to make efforts to facilitate? How will you facilitate them?
By ensuring that sentimental values of every community member are being respected and kept at the utmost priority. To ensure this, codeof conduct will be followed strictly and anyone violating the rules will have to face severe consequences.

### Needs not facilitated
What needs won't you be able to facilitate? Why is this?
Being a non-profit community, ensuring that every member gets reimbursement for various expenses like travelling can be really challenging
but I'll try my best to get some funding from profitable organisations to tackle this issue.

## Provide a link to your Code of Conduct
Every community should have a clear Code of Conduct. It should be specific about what behavior is encouraged, what is unacceptable, and how you will respond to those who break the rules. It should also be accessible easily online - so please provide a link to it here.
Note: this should be a specific code of conduct for your community, not a generic one.
