### Workshop introduction
- What is the title of your workshop?
Home Automation
- Who is the target audience?
Engineering students with background in Computer Science Or Electronics. 
- How long will your workshop be?
4 hours.

## Learning objectives
List 2-3 learning objectives. These generally start with 'learners will understand' or 'learners can'. Remember to be realistic about what can be achieved in the length of your workshop.
- Learners will understand the importance of Home Autmoation and how can it make our life easy.
- Learners can create their own Home Automation devices at home with very less cost and customise it as per their requirements.
- The workshops can help them to get interested in coding and might motivate them to try coding.

## Assessment
- What will learners make to show you that they've mastered each learning objective? 
Learners will make a small project of Home Automation by making atleast one bulb turn on or off through Google Assistant.

- What is the criteria for success for each objective?
At the end of the workshop, students will be able to control devices using either mobile. Adding capablitites of controlling devices
using their voice to operate appliances through Google Assistant or Alexa. At the end, controlling the devices wirelessly from any place
in the world and combining all the earlier criteria will be the criteria for success.

## Activities
What content, exercises and support will you provide to help learners work towards the assessment? Here are some tips:

- Create discrete steps - build multiple smaller things that add up to something bigger
- Authentic - only design activities that teach skills which learners will actually use in the assessment
- Agency & Appeal: make sure that activities matter to learners, and they want to be able to do it
- How will you utilise the Pain Dream Fix model in your activities?

- Ask participants what Home Automation is. Ask how they are used. If no one can define it, then explain that home automation is a system with which one can control their appliances wirelessly.
- Provide examples of home automation. The best example is google home or alexa.
- Play some videos of how home automation works.
- Show them real-life model of home automation built by the team and control some devices using it.
- Explain that they will now create a small home automation project.
